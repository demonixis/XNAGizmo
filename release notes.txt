XNA 3D Gizmo component. (XNA 4.0)

This beta release features a completely new Gizmo. It supports both local and world transformations and is much cleaner and more
intuitive than the previous release.

Along with the GizmoComponent.cs there are a few essential classes (BoundingOrientedBox.cs and Quad.cs) These classes are available
in the sample/source-code and have been taken from other XNA Samples. These classes are used in  the GizmoComponent and are required.

In the "Framework" folder you'll find several classes including input managers that are used by the component but can relatively easy
be replaced by your own editor/framework code. I've tried to keep them as non-intrusive if possible, however I can't fully predict
everyones coding habits, so some re-work may be required if you're going to hook your own input on the gizmo.

Credit is due for Sean James (MouseDevice.cs) and XNA CC for Quad.cs/BoundingOrientedBox.cs

I hope this component will be of good use to you if you're working on your own editor...

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to let me know on Codeplex or on my Blog. I'd like to make this component
as complete and painless to implement as possible!
